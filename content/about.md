A lot of time has past since my last blog post (apologies, if you were on the edge of your seat), but I’ve now released my second blog post about the connection between linear algebra and Fourier analysis (my two favorite flavors of mathematics). Check it out below!

Also check out my first blog post below in which I give my two cents on how engineers (and scientists!) should be introduced to radio interferometry.
